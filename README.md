## Hi there, I'm ThePhaseCat! I'm a programmer, artist, and content creator for Youtube, Twitch, and Tiktok! Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

In programming, I currently work in GDScript, Java, and a little bit of C#!

I'm having a blast programming and working on so many cool projects!

Here's a link to the first game I've ever released, The Complex!

# I'm current working on...
- Phase: Tale of the Two-Tailed Stone, my huge passion project I've been working on since May 2023!
- Phase's Discord Rich Presence, a new mod I'm working on to add Discord Rich Presence support to Minecraft!
- A resource pack for my Minecraft SMP, the PhaseSMP!
- Content Creation!

# Plans for things I want to do...
- A Minecraft Content Mod (Maybe a new dimension)
- Platformer Project
- Endless Runner Project (maybe for mobile?)

# How to reach me...
You can reach me by using the social links in this link: https://phasecat.carrd.co/
