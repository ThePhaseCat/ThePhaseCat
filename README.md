## Hi there, I'm ThePhaseCat! I'm a programmer, artist, and content creator for Youtube, Twitch, and Tiktok! Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

In programming, I currently work in GDScript and Java!

I'm still pretty new to this whole programming thing, but I'm having a blast programming right now!

Also, my first game just released, called The Complex! Check it out!
