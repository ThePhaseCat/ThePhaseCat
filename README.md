## Hi there, I'm ThePhaseCat! I'm a programmer, artist, and content creator for Youtube, Twitch, and Tiktok! Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

In programming, I mainly work in GDScript and Java, as I have the most amount of experience working in those two languages.

I'm still learning Godot and Java, but I'm having a blast right now learning them!

Also, my first game just released, called The Complex! Check it out!

- Both a resource pack and a server-side plugin for my Minecraft SMP, the PhaseSMP!
- Game Dev Club game at my school, mainly on the ideas and art side of things!
- Content Creation!

# Plans for things I want to do...
