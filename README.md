## Hi there, I'm ThePhaseCat! Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer who mainly works in GDScript and Java, but I'm not afraid to try new things!
I'm also a bit of an artist, but I would say my work is quite bad...
I also do content on the side cause it's fun!

# I'm current working on...
- My own game in Godot (The Complex, which is in a private repo!)
- A resource Pack for my Minecraft Server, the PhaseSMP!
- A server-side plugin for my Minecraft Server, the PhaseSMP!
- Doing art on the side for my school's Game Dev Club game!
- Content Creation!

# Plans for things I want to do...
- Endless Runner game in Godot
- Top-down 2D puzzle game in Godot
- Demake of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet in Godot
- Pokemon Fangame in Godot
- Sonic Fangame in Godot
- Fortnite Resource Pack for Minecraft
